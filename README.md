# 📄 PDF Q&A System

A full-stack **PDF Question-Answering (Q&A) system** that allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions based on their content.  
The backend is powered by **.NET Core** for file handling and API management, while **LangChain with Python** handles AI-based embedding, retrieval, and Q&A.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **PDF Upload & Management**  
  Users can upload multiple PDF files for processing.
  
- **AI-Powered Question Answering**  
  Uses **LangChain** and vector embeddings to answer questions from PDF content.
  
- **.NET Core Backend**  
  - Handles file uploads, API requests, and integration with the Python service.
  - Includes folder structure for `Controllers`, `Services`, and `Helpers`.
  
- **Python AI Service**  
  - Extracts text, generates embeddings, and performs Q&A.
  - Uses **FAISS / Chroma** for vector search.
  - Can integrate with **OpenAI/Gemini** or other LLMs for response generation.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### **Backend (.NET Core)**

1. Navigate to `PdfQAApp/`
2. Restore packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
3. Run the API
   ```bash
   dotnet run

   
Python AI Service
Navigate to PYTHON/ folder

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Python service:

bash
Copy
Edit
python apiBridge.py
🔗 API Workflow
Upload PDF → Backend stores in /uploads

Backend calls Python AI → Sends PDF path for processing

Python returns embeddings/Q&A response → Backend sends response to frontend

📝 Notes
uploads/ folders are ignored by Git to avoid committing large files.

config.json stores API keys and credentials and should remain local.

Ensure Python and .NET services run simultaneously for full functionality.

📌 Future Enhancements
React-based frontend for interactive Q&A.

Multi-PDF querying and comparison.

User authentication & session-based PDF history.

Dockerized deployment for easier hosting.

Let me know if you want:
- Badges (like `.NET`, `Python`, `OpenAI`, etc.)  
- A version with screenshots or demo GIF  
- A public link preview to test the GitHub rendering  

Happy building 🚀
